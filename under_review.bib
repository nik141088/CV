	abstract = {We build a Kyle-type pricing model with earnings and trading signals and estimate its deep parameters - the information advantages of traders and firms, the correlation between the firm and traders’ information, and the variance of noise trades. Moment conditions derived from the pricing rule allow for a radically simple GMM strategy, and we validate our model both asymptotically with the J-statistic but also in a finite sample. For our sample from Indian markets, we find that traders know more about firm payoffs than firms themselves. For many firms, because firms and traders disagree, and the latter’s information advantage is large, the market’s weight on unexpected earnings is negative, causing good news to be bad news.},
