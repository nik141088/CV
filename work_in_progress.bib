	abstract = {The debate on disagreement-return relation is unsettled with evidence of negative relationship in Miller (1977) and positive relationship in Williams (1977). Using a novel disagreement measure constructed using the dispersion in trading signals originating from return anomalies, I find support for both the hypothesis. Moreover, disagreement subsumes the previously documented turnover return relationship. Future stock returns are positive when disagreement is moderate, but the relationship flips wwith higher levels of disagreement. The effect gives support to Miller (1977) hypothesis of a negative future return when disagreement is high and short sale constraints bind.},

	abstract = {Firm's information environment affects the disagreement volume relationship. The relation is stronger whenever the value relevant information doesn't flow to investors. Measuring the extent of the weakening of information flow by the coefficient on disagreement in disagreement-volume regressions, I find that the flow of information is disrupted at several points. Reduced analyst following, convoluted disclosures and stale information disrupt the flow of information to investors. In absence of sufficient information, investors rely on simpler and readily avaialble return anomalies for their trading decisions.},
