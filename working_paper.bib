	abstract = {I propose a new measure of investor disagreement using trading signals from a broad set of return predicting anomalies constructed using the firmâ€™s fundamentals and market price. Disagreement is higher for small, growth, and riskier stocks, which exhibit high fundamental uncertainty. The dispersion of trading signals significantly explains the next period trading volume over and above the factors identified in earlier literature. A move from 25th to 75th disagreement percentile predicts 12.7% higher turnover next period. The positive and significant relationship is robust to different specifications, alternative measures of turnover and disagreement, across size groups, and time periods. Portfolio sorts offer similar evidence.},
