I am a Lead Data Scientist at Target Corporation, where I lead a team of data scientists in developing digital supply chain simulations for last mile operations, focusing on order allocation and available-to-promise models. I specialize in transforming business challenges into data-driven solutions and drive improvements through algorithm design, product development, and code reviews. Prior to Target, I managed a data science team at WNS Global Services, delivering machine learning and analytics solutions for finance and auditing functions. I have extensive experience in Python, PySpark, R programming, machine learning, software engineering, and data pipelines, with a proven track record of optimizing workflows and enhancing operational efficiency. I hold a Ph.D. in Finance and Accounting and have presented my work at international conferences.
